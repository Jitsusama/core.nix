# What Quickshell needs from the system: a PAM service of its own for the
# lock screen, which checks the account's password and nothing else (its
# polkit prompt goes through polkit's own service), a watcher that says
# whether caps lock is on, which nothing else tells it, and its build.
#
# Quickshell 0.3.1's notification server never sends a program the
# activation token a compositor asks before it lets the program bring its
# window forward, so a notice's action reached the program but couldn't
# take Joel to the conversation or tab it was about. The patch
# (activation-token.patch says how) asks the compositor for one tied to the
# click or key that chose the action, and sends it first, as version 1.2 of
# the notifications specification has it. It's laid over the machine's
# packages, so the shell, the greeter and the lock all run it.
#
# The watcher (keyboard-lights.rs) reads the keyboards, which is what a
# keylogger needs, so it gets nothing else: an account of its own, the input
# group, read access to input devices alone, no network and a read-only
# system but for its directory. It asks the kernel for the caps lock light
# and nothing more, so a keystroke never reaches it.
#
# Its directory is made at boot and stays until shutdown: Quickshell watches
# the file through its directory, and loses the watch for good if the
# directory goes or isn't there yet. A runtime directory of systemd's would
# go each time the watcher restarted, and one it keeps, with an account it
# makes, moves where Quickshell can't read.
